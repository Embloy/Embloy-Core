## Functionality

> __NOTE__: _This file covers the web-application. If you are looking for the API documentation instead, go to_
___[api.md](app/controllers/api/v0/api.md)___

### Filtering of Available Jobs and Creating an "Intelligent" Feed

***The FeedGenerator has been migrated to an external system after mutual agreement among the developers. Although the details of the project are confidential, a basic understanding of its functionality is necessary to work on the Rails backend. The enhanced FeedGenerator features a single REST API endpoint, which can only be accessed by the Rails server via an authentication barrier. Credentials are provided on a need-to-know basis. The FeedGenerator ranks each element of a set of jobs (or "slice") that are provided by the Rails backend. The resulting feed is then displayed to the user.***

### User Authentication

Users can set up an account with their email address and password, or choose to log in using the OAuth2.0 services
provided by Google and GitHub.

Passwords are instantly encrypted using [bcryt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt) and stored in the database as an
encrypted hash. In case a user forgets their password, it can be reset via standard email authentication.

For an optimal user experience, it is recommended to fill out the 'Preferences' field under 'My Profile'.
To log into the application, users can use the aforementioned OAuth2.0 services or enter their password.
If a user forgets their password, they can reset it by providing their email address and following the specified
procedure in the email.

### Managing Applications for Available Jobs

The system is capable of managing jobs and applications, supporting
basic [CRUD operations](https://www.javatpoint.com/crud-operations-in-sql), and notifying the employer when a new
application is submitted, as well as notifying the applicant when their application is accepted or rejected.

All notifications are sent via [SMTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol).

## How it Works

To get started, simply visit [our website](http://embloy.com/) and create a new account or log in with an existing
account. It's that easy!

## Config

> __NOTE__: _You only need to follow these steps if you wish to contribute and need to test your changes locally_

<details>
  <summary> 1. Prerequisites </summary>

- Install Ruby 2.7.5

- Install Rails 7

- Install Postgresql 15

- Open pgAdmin4

- Add a new server

</details>

<details>
  <summary> 2. Connect to our remote database </summary>

-     hostname/address: <special authorization needed>

-     maintanence database: <special authorization needed>

-     username: <special authorization needed>

-     password: <special authorization needed>

-      port: 5432

</details>

<details>
  <summary> 3. Start the server </summary>

If you wish to experiment on our backend or contribute to our front end you can test your changes by starting a local
server.

1. Create a file 'config/env_var.rb' with the following content:

   ```
   ENV['DATABASE_HOST'] = <special authorization needed>
   ENV['DATABASE_PASSWORD'] = <special authorization needed>
   ENV['DATABASE_URL'] = <special authorization needed>
   ENV['DATABASE_USER'] = <special authorization needed>
   ENV['GITHUB_KEY'] = <special authorization needed>
   ENV['GITHUB_SECRET'] = <special authorization needed>
   ENV['GOOGLE_OAUTH2_KEY'] = <special authorization needed>
   ENV['GOOGLE_OAUTH2_SECRET'] = <special authorization needed>
   ENV['RAILS_MASTER_KEY'] = <special authorization needed>
    ```

1. Run ``$ rails db:create`` to create all necessary tables in your development database.
2. Run ``$ rails db:migrate`` to migrate your changes to the database.
3. Run ``$ rails server`` to start the server.
4. Add the following lines manually when resetting the current database or creating a new database:

```
CREATE EXTENSION postgis;
ALTER TABLE jobs ADD COLUMN job_value public.geography(PointZ,4326);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS job_job_value_index
ON public.jobs USING gist
(job_value)
TABLESPACE pg_default;
```

</details>

4. Go to http://localhost:3000
